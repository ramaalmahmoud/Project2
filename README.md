# Project2
I have prepared wireframes and mockups for a baby clothing website meticulously using Figma. The site consists of five main pages: Home, Services, Log In, Registration, and Payment. The Home page displays a preview of baby clothing products, while the Services page outlines additional offerings. The Log In and Registration pages facilitate authentication and account creation processes respectively. Finally, the Payment page streamlines the payment process. Each page's layout and functions have been carefully designed to ensure a seamless user experience.
